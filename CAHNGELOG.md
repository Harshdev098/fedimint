# v0.6.0 - On-Chain for Everyone

Fedimint `v0.6.0` is here! :tada:

The on-chain wallet is no longer considered "expert-only."

Since `v0.4.0`, Fedimint developers advised not exposing on-chain deposits to end users, due to limitations on processing deposits in very large (in bytes) on-chain transactions. This limitations has been lifted and on-chain deposits are now safe in all cases.

Some other highlights since our last major (0.5) release:

- Federation will now reject attempt to reuse ecash blind nonces, preventing possibility of loss of funds even in the event of client-side bugs and data corruption, significantly increasing ecash robustness and funds safety.
- Fedimint will now query (configurable) external sources for feerate information to improve real time fee estimation.
- On-chain feerate multiplier have been lowered, as it no longer needs to be as conservative.
- LN payment events are now tracked, allowing tracking profit and fees statistics.
- It's now possible to customize  LNv2 gateway fees.
- Client recovery has been optimized and should be faster and use less data.
- Core lightning gateway is no longer supported.
- Work has been started on Iroh networking integration
- Fedimintd should use less memory now.

... and many, many internal changes and improvements. See [commit log](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/compare/v0.6.0...v0.5.0).

# v0.5.0 - Christmas Edition

Fedimint v0.5.0 is here! :tada:

Some highlights since our last major (0.4) release:
* Tor support for client-federation connections (see [`Connector` enum](https://docs.rs/fedimint-api-client/latest/fedimint_api_client/api/net/enum.Connector.html)) (thx @oleonardolima!)
* Stabilization of v2 of our lightning module. While not being rolled out by default yet integration and testing is encouraged. (thx @joschisan and @m1sterc001guy!)
* Upgraded rust-bitcoin (and related ecosystem-crates) from 0.30 to 0.32, which should be a [stable shelling point for the foreseeable future](https://github.com/rust-bitcoin/rust-bitcoin/issues/3166#issuecomment-2288739453) and leads fewer duplicates dependencies (thx @tvolk131!)
* Multiple bug fixes that were already backported to 0.3 and 0.4, but came out of refactoring and review work of modules (thx @bradleystachurski and @joschisan!)
* CI improvements to increase our agility while maintaining compatibility guarantees (thx @dpc and @bradleystachurski!)

As usual, there was lots more maintenance, debugging and integration going on in the background. Big thanks to everyone who contributes getting Fedimint closer to being the go-to, bulletproof community custody tool in Bitcoin!

I also asked GPT to summarize what else happened, ymmv:

# v0.4.4
# v0.4.3
# v0.4.2
# v0.4.1

This patch release fixes a bug when using esplora bitcoin backend.

[Please refer to v0.4.0 release notes for general v0.4 release information.](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/releases/tag/v0.4.0)


#  v0.4.0 - Rotation Station

⚠️ **CAUTION** ⚠️

Please refer to the upgrade docs for upgrading `fedimintd` older than 0.4.0. Clients are not effected.

https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/blob/master/docs/RELEASE_NOTES-v0.4.md

## Release Notes


* Changing peer's DNS names is now possible.
* On chain deposits are now considered "expert-only" .
* On chain deposit charge fees by default to counter dust attacks.
* Wallet client module implements backup and recovery.
* Wallet client module is robust w.r.t deposit address reuse and rbf transactions.
* Client reconnection backoff was improved.
* RBF withdrawal functionality was removed.
* It's possible to finish DKG (setting up Federation) using only the `fedimint-cli` tool.

... and many, many internal changes and improvements.


#### On chain deposits are now considered "expert-only"

Given growing Fedimint usage, Fedimint developers officially recommend applications integrating fedimintd NOT to expose on-chain deposits to the end uses. LN Gateways and Mint guardians are recommended to use `fedimint-cli` to manage deposits.

In the near future we are planning to implement changes necessary to make on-chain deposits easy to use for all users. For further details, please refer to https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/issues/5585.

####  Changing peer DNS names is now possible

Due to incidents where some Federations lost their guardian's DNS name and were unable to rotate DNS names, implementing a scheme that allows it was prioritized and implemented.

In the mid-term future we are planning to remove the DNS requirement altogether.

#### Wallet client module rewrite

The wallet client module was updated to accommodate deposit address reuse, rbf deposits, and streamline the backup and restore system.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1


# v0.3.0: Forward, backward, sideward compatibility?
## Upgrading
### `fedimintd`
* Stop all federation guardian `fedimintd`s
* Make a backup of the whole data dir (contains a bunch of JSON files and a `database` directory)
* Verify that all `fedimintd`s in the federation are off
* Upgrade the `fedimintd` binary through the deployment method of your choice
* Restart all `fedimintd`s
* Verify in the admin UI or via `fedimint-cli` that all of them are online again and making progress producing sessions

Note that, when upgrading from 0.2, you will not get the new Meta module, which otherwise gets added automatically to new setups now. In 0.4 we will add functionality that will allow retroactively adding the module. For compatibility with old clients it is still advised to use the `meta_override_url` field.

### Clients
Just using the new version of the client library should do. There were some rust interface changes, especially around LN gateways, but nothing too major. Reach out on GitHub or [Discord](https://chat.fedimint.org) if anything is unclear.

## Downgrading
Downgrading to previous versions is unsupported and will likely fail.

## What's Changed

### New Features:
* Dynamic meta fields through the Meta module
* Improved load-test-metrics for better performance insights.
* Capability to pass --auth flag to fedimint-cli dev api.
* Added recovery tool tests for enhanced reliability.

* CLI improvements and more configurable options.
* Added support to pay a lnurls.
* Implemented a special case descriptor for single-guardian instances for smaller on-chain transactions.
* Introduced versioned Gateway API for backward compatibility.
* Introduced a latency test for restore functions.

### Fixes and Updates:
* Introduced a simplification for always proposing block height and feerate votes.
* Multiple fixes including singular naming in MintOperationMetaVariant, serialization of enums in snake case for API consistency and adjustment for HTLC processing.
* Addressing warnings and errors for more robust operations and deployment.
* Various fixes to ensure compatibility and optimization across different platforms, networking conditions and operational scenarios.
* Database migrations for consistency and performance.
* Client-side transaction size checks to prevent unexpected server-side rejections

### Chore and Maintenance:
* Several chores to clean up code, improve build and testing processes, and update dependencies.
  *Introduction of concurrency and latency optimizations.
* Documentation improvements including more information on cargo packages and updating READMEs.
* Refactoring efforts for cleaner and more maintainable code design.

### Security:

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/compare/v0.2.2...v0.3.0

#  v0.2.2: : Federate all the Things II

This release fixes a lot of bugs, both client authors and federation operators are recommended to upgrade.

## Guardian Upgrade Process
We recommend proceeding as follows:
* Coordinate a time with all guardians
* Everyone shuts down their `fedimintd` service
* Make a backup of the data dir
* Upgrade `fedimintd` to v0.2.2 (how depends on the deployment method)
* Check that the version matches for everyone by running `fedimintd version-hash`
* Everyone starts their `fedimintd` service again

While this is not a consensus upgrade and thus doesn't require coordination we recommend not running different versions of `fedimintd` together since it is not supported and hasn't been tested.

## Highlighted Changes

* [Fix liveness bug in case guardians are offline](https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/commit/66d7faff1f7b330f0be1455ac0ef8c49a1489da2)
